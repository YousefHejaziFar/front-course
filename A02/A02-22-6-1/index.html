    <div class="box-1">
      <h2>Overflow: visible</h2>
      <p>
        By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and
        it renders outside the element's box:
      </p>
      <div class="visible">
        You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control
        of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
        overflows an element's box.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="box-2">
      <h2>Overflow: hidden</h2>
      <p>
        With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the
        content is hidden:
      </p>
      <p>Try to remove the overflow property to understand how it works.</p>
      <div class="hidden">
        You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control
        of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
        overflows an element's box.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="box-3">
      <h2>Overflow: scroll</h2>
      <p>
        Setting the overflow value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a
        scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a
        scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):
      </p>
      <div class="scroll">
        You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control
        of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
        overflows an element's box.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="box-4">
      <h2>Overflow: auto</h2>
      <p>
        The auto value is similar to scroll, only it add scrollbars when
        necessary:
      </p>
      <div class="auto">
        You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control
        of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
        overflows an element's box.
