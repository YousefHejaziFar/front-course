        Night (also described as nighttime,unconventionally spelled as"nite") is
        the period of ambient darkness from sunset to sunrise during each
        24-hour day, when the Sun is below the horizon. The exact time when
        night begins and ends depends on the location and varies throughout the
        year, based on factors such as season and latitude.
