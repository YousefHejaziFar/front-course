          <p>
            The sky is an unobstructed view upward from the surface of the
            Earth. It includes the atmosphere and outer space. It may also be
            considered a place between the ground and outer space, thus distinct
            from outer space. In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called
            the celestial sphere. This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the
            Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be
            drifting. The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into
            designated areas called constellations.
