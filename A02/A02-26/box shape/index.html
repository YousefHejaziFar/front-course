        <h1>Mechanic</h1>
        <p>
          Most mechanics specialize in a particular field, such as auto body
          mechanics, air conditioning and refrigeration mechanics, auto
          mechanics, bicycle mechanics, boiler mechanics, race car mechanics,
          aircraft mechanics, and other areas.[2] A mechanic is typically
          certified by a trade association or regional government power.
          Mechanics may be separated into two classes based on the type of
          machines they work on, heavyweight and lightweight. Heavyweight work
          is on larger machines or heavy equipment, such as tractors and
          trailers, while lightweight work is on smaller items, such as
          automotive engines.
