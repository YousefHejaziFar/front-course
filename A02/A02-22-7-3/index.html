        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous
        mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae
        and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to
        distinguish it from the wild members of the family.

        The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a
        domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is
        derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the
        dog's nearest living relative
