          <h1>Mountain</h1>
          <p>
            A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally
            with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although
            definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a
            limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically
            rising at least 300 metres (980 ft) above the surrounding land. A
            few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain
            ranges.
