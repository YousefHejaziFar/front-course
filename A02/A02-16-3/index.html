          CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
          including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
          content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
          specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
          pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
          .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
          content; and enable the.

            css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
            pages that share the file and its formatting.</span
          >
          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
          the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
          methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based
          browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS
          also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on
          a mobile device.
