      <h1>Alps</h1>
      <p>
        The Alps (/Ã¦lps/) are the highest and most extensive mountain range that
        is entirely in Europe, stretching approximately 1,200 km (750 mi) across
        seven Alpine countries (from west to east): France, Switzerland, Italy,
        Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia. The Alpine arch extends
        from Nice on the western Mediterranean to Trieste on the Adriatic and
        Vienna at the beginning of the Pannonian Basin. The mountains were
        formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian
        tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event
        resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding
        into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn.
