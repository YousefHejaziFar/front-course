        <h1>Moon</h1>
        <p>
          The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average
          distance of 384400 km (238900 mi), about 30 times the planet's
          diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because
          gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. This results
          in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month. The Moon's
          gravitational pull and to a lesser extent the Sun's are the main
          drivers of the tides. The Moon is in geophysical terms a
          planetary-mass object or satellite planet. It has a mass that amounts
          to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of
          Earth's or with 3,474 km (2,159 mi) about as wide as Australia.[17]
          Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite
          in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest
          moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf
          planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about
          half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest
          among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is differentiated
          and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or
          magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after
          Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth
          and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.

        <h1>Saturn</h1>
        <p>
          Saturn is the sixth planet in the solar system from the sun and, with
          an equatorial diameter of around 120,500 kilometers (9.5 times the
          diameter of the Earth), the second largest after Jupiter . However ,
          at 95 Earth masses , it only has 30% of the mass of Jupiter. Because
          of its striking ring system , which is visible even in small
          telescopes , it is often called the ring planet , although ring
          systems have also been found on the other three gas planets . Saturn
          has an average distance to the sun of a good 1.43 billion kilometers;
          its orbit runs between that of Jupiter and that of Uranus , which is
          further away from the sun . It is the outermost planet that is clearly
          visible to the naked eye and was therefore known for thousands of
          years before the invention of the telescope .Saturn is the sixth
          planet in the solar system from the sun and, with an equatorial
          diameter of around 120,500 kilometers (9.5 times the diameter of the
          Earth), the second largest after Jupiter . However , at 95 Earth
          masses , it only has 30% of the mass of Jupiter. Because of its
          striking ring system , which is visible even in small telescopes , it
          is often called the ring planet , although ring systems have also been

        <h1>Sky</h1>
        <p>
          Sky Deutschland GmbH, branded as Sky, is a German media company that
          operates a direct broadcast satellite Pay TV platform in Germany,
          Austria and Switzerland (through Sky Switzerland). It provides a
          collection of basic and premium digital subscription television
          channels of different categories via satellite and cable television.
          It was launched in 1991 as Premiere. The channel originally started as
          a single analogue channel on the Astra 1A satellite, showing films
          dubbed into German, as well as in original audio, live football
          matches from the German Bundesliga and Austrian Bundesliga (and at one
          time the UEFA Cup), and documentaries and TV series. After the coming
          of the digital age, the service has since consisted of many channels
          with many new ones added over the years. On 4 July 2009, the service
          and its channels were rebranded as "Sky".[3][4] Sky Deutschland is a
          wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast-owned Sky.[5][6] The programming
          service itself is provided by its subsidiary Sky Deutschland Fernsehen
          GmbH & Co. KG (formerly Premiere Fernsehen GmbH & Co. KG). It topped
          3,000,000 subscribers by the end of 2011. As of Q2 2014, Sky
          Deutschland has more than 4 million subscribers.
